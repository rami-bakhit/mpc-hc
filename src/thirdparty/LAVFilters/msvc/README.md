# LAV Filters with MSVC only

This directory builds the ffmpeg that LAV Filters uses, and the external
libraries ffmpeg links against, with Visual Studio's compiler and MSBuild.
Together with `src\LAVFilters.sln` (already MSVC) that makes the whole of
MPC-HC's internal filters buildable without MinGW-w64, GCC or MSYS2.
`..\build_lavfilters.bat` uses it whenever no MinGW-w64 gcc is configured; when
one is, the historical GCC path (how upstream releases are built) stays the
default and is untouched. `MPCHC_LAV_TOOLCHAIN=MSVC` or `=GCC` in
`build.user.bat`, or the `MSVC`/`GCC` switch, picks explicitly.

What a normal build needs: Visual Studio, and `nasm.exe` on `PATH` for
ffmpeg's and dav1d's x86 assembly. That is all. No shell, no make, nothing
generated at build time.

## Layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `common.props` | shared settings: toolset (taken from LAV's own `platform.props`), output into LAV's `bin_<platform>[d]\` like the GCC build, CRT and optimisation flags |
| `libs\<lib>\` | one MSBuild project per external library, next to its source (a git submodule, except opencore-amr which has no upstream repository and is vendored). Config headers those libraries' own build systems would generate are committed under `libs\<lib>\include`. |
| `ffmpeg\<lib>.vcxproj` | one project per ffmpeg DLL (avutil, swresample, swscale, avcodec, avformat, avfilter) |
| `ffmpeg\ffmpeg-compiler.props` | picks the C compiler for ffmpeg: clang when Visual Studio's Clang components are installed, cl otherwise (`/p:FFmpegCompiler=cl` or `clang` overrides) |
| `ffmpeg\ffmpeg.props` | compiler flags, exactly what ffmpeg's configure chooses for the compiler in use; nasm and resource handling |
| `ffmpeg\<compiler>\items-<lib>-<platform>.props` | generated: the source list of each DLL, taken from the object list of a configured make tree |
| `ffmpeg\<compiler>\generated\<platform>\` | generated: `config.h`, `config_components.h`, `config.asm`, `avconfig.h`, `ffversion.h`, the `*_list.c` component tables and the `.def` export lists |
| `regen\` | maintainer tooling that produces the generated files (see below) |

## cl or clang

Both are Visual Studio compilers producing MSVC-ABI DLLs on the same CRT as
LAV's own filters, and both sets of generated files are committed. cl works on
any Visual Studio installation. clang needs two optional components,
"C++ Clang Compiler for Windows" and "MSBuild support for LLVM (clang-cl)
toolset", and is chosen automatically when they are present because it is
measurably better for ffmpeg: it compiles ffmpeg's GCC-style inline assembly,
which cl cannot, so `HAVE_INLINE_ASM` is on in its configuration. Measured on
the same clip with the same harness, H.264 software decoding with cl is about
10% slower than the GCC build; with clang it is on par with GCC. dav1d's AV1
decoding is at parity for all three, its hot paths being nasm assembly.

The two LAV-specific HEVC intrinsic files (`libavcodec\x86\hevc\*_intrinsic.c`)
carry `#pragma GCC target("sse4.1")`, which clang ignores; `ffmpeg.props` gives
those two files `-mssse3 -msse4.1` explicitly, the same scope the pragma has
under gcc.

Three more things the clang path needed, all in `ffmpeg.props` and
`ffmpeg-linker.props`:

* The ClangCL toolset links with lld-link by default, which cannot consume the
  whole-program-optimised objects in MPC-HC's `zlib.lib`; the ffmpeg projects
  link with link.exe under both compilers.
* clang 22 (the version Visual Studio ships) makes incompatible pointer types
  an error by default; ffmpeg's own configure treats them as warnings, so the
  projects do too (`-Wno-error=incompatible-pointer-types` and friends).
* `UNICODE` must not be defined for ffmpeg: it calls `LoadLibrary` with narrow
  strings, which clang rejects outright and cl silently miscompiles into a
  call that fails at run time. `common.props` therefore leaves the character
  set unset for everything in this directory.

The DLLs, their import libraries and the external static libraries land in
`src\bin_<platform>[d]\` and `...\lib\`, and the generated headers are copied
to `src\bin_<platform>[d]\thirdparty\ffmpeg\`, which is where LAV's own
projects have always looked for them. `build_lavfilters.bat` then builds
`LAVFilters.sln` and copies the results into MPC-HC's output directory as
before.

## Adjustments to the submodule without patching it

`..\Directory.Build.props` and `..\Directory.Build.targets` (one directory up) are
picked up by MSBuild for every project under `src\thirdparty\LAVFilters`, the
submodule's included.  They already carry the two adjustments LAV's own projects
need, so this build relies on them rather than patching the submodule:

* `IntelQuickSyncDecoder.vcxproj` (LAV's nested qsdecoder submodule) maps Visual
  Studio versions to toolsets itself and stops at 17.0; the props file supplies
  the 18.0 mapping.
* DSUtilLite's pre-build step runs LAV's `common\genversion.bat`, which needs a
  bash under `%MPCHC_MSYS%`; the targets file swaps it for `..\genversion.cmd`.

So a build touches no shell at all.

## Library configuration

The option set is that of `build_ffmpeg.sh` (the GCC path). The one
difference is TLS: gnutls with nettle and gmp does not build with MSVC and is
replaced by schannel, ffmpeg's native Windows TLS, which is also what LAV
upstream's own MSVC script uses. Everything else is at parity; the enabled
decoders, demuxers, parsers, hardware accelerators, filters and bitstream
filters are identical, and the only components lost with gnutls are the
legacy encrypted-RTMP protocols `rtmpe`, `rtmpte` and `ffrtmpcrypt`.

| Library | Version | Source of the file list |
|---|---|---|
| dav1d | 1.5.3 | `src/meson.build` (x86, 8 and 16 bit) |
| libxml2 | 2.11.5 | `win32/Makefile.msvc`, without ftp/http/iconv/zlib/python, as LAV's build |
| speex | 1.2.1 | `libspeex/Makefile.am`, floating point |
| opencore-amr | 0.1.6 | `amrnb/Makefile.am` (decoder only) and `amrwb/Makefile.am` |

## Regenerating after a LAV Filters or library bump

ffmpeg's configure is a shell script and its Makefiles need GNU make, so the
generated files are produced once by a maintainer and committed, in the same
way `src\thirdparty\ffmpeg` (the player's own ffmpeg.lib) has always carried
its `config.h`. Run:

    msvc\regen\regen.cmd [x64] [Win32]

It builds MPC-HC's zlib and the external libraries for each platform,
configures and builds ffmpeg out of tree under `regen\build\<platform>-<compiler>`
(ignored by git), and rewrites `ffmpeg\<compiler>\` and `libs\*\*.vcxproj`.
The cl set is always produced; the clang set is produced when Visual Studio's
Clang component is installed, or when `CLANG_BIN` points at another LLVM's
`bin` directory. Review the diff and commit it.

It needs a POSIX shell with GNU make and pkg-config besides nasm. The shell
is Git for Windows' bash (`MPCHC_GIT`), deliberately: MSYS2's runtime hides
`INCLUDE` and `LIB` from nested msys processes, so under MSYS2's own bash
ffmpeg's configure never sees the compiler environment. GNU make and
pkg-config are copied out of an MSYS2 installation (`MPCHC_MSYS`, default
`C:\msys64`) into `regen\build\bin`, where they run on Git's runtime; without
MSYS2, put a `make.exe` and `pkg-config.exe` on `PATH` yourself. The compiler
flags in `ffmpeg.props` are not generated; if a new ffmpeg changes what
`--toolchain=msvc` emits, compare against `CFLAGS` in
`regen\build\<platform>\ffbuild\config.mak`.

## Known differences from the GCC build

* schannel instead of gnutls, see above.
* PDBs are native; no cv2pdb step.
* The `sanm` decoder, which LAV's Debug MSVC build used to exclude, compiles
  and is enabled.
